# 15-Day SQL Challenge by PrepVector

Welcome to my repository for the 15-Day SQL Challenge by PrepVector! In this repository, you'll find my solutions to each day's SQL challenges, which helped me to refresh and strengthen my SQL skills. The challenges cover a range of topics and difficulty levels, from easy to hard.

🚀 Project Overview
This challenge helped me practice key SQL concepts, including:
Joins & Self Joins
Window Functions
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CASE WHEN Statements
Subqueries and Aggregations

📅 Challenge Structure
The challenges were released daily on the PrepVector platform for 15 days starting from March 24th 2025!

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL Database: SQLite (used for solving the challenges)

Web Platforms: PrepVector and LiveCodes

You do not need to set up any environment locally to participate in the challenge. All challenges were hosted and solved directly on the platform.
